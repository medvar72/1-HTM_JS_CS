00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.620
All right, let's look at handling file
upload from the form point of view.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.130
So basically, it's enough skills
after this presentation so

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.980
that you can actually handle some
kind of file upload system, but

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.280
we don't really look at
the server side of things.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.160
So, this is all related to one particular
attribute, file type, input type is file.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.720
So, there's actually two sides when
you want to build a system which will

7
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.420
upload a file and
then send it to a server program,

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.410
and then the server program
has a copy of the file.

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
Of course, you have to handle
the form side of things, usually, and

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.400
also the server side,
program side of things.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.070
Now, this presentation is pretty quick.

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.900
We're just focused on the form side of
things rather than the server side.

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.279
So, let's have a look
at a basic structure.

14
00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:57.031
We know that we have form,
we know that we have some kind of action,

15
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:58.249
some kind of method.

16
00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.050
Something we haven't seen before,
encode type.

17
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.480
That tells the browser when
we send the file to attach,

18
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.210
let's use the word attach,
to attach the file, or

19
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.870
files, that you want to upload to
the message which goes to the server.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.823
All right?
So that's essential if you're doing file

21
00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:21.100
upload, all right?

22
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.549
If you're not doing file upload,
you can kind of forget about it.

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.910
The other thing is this, method is post.

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.640
Well, we had a brief
discussion of that before.

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.130
If you're doing big things like files,

26
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270
absolutely essential you
use the post method.

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.420
Use the get method, it totally won't work.

28
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.760
Use the post method and
it should work, okay?

29
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.370
So that's some extra things
you have to think about.

30
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.170
You also have to do this
kind of thing here.

31
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.500
This gives you a file selector.

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.680
So the user sees the form,
sees the file selector, click on it,

33
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.900
select the file in the hard disk, and

34
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.470
then press submit button,
off goes the file to the server program.

35
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.660
Here's a real world example where
I've filled in the parameters.

36
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.160
So yes, post method, and
there's an exact URL.

37
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.900
And the other stuff is
pretty much the same.

38
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.900
Some kind of submit button,
some kind of file selector button, okay?

39
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.740
So that's a real world example.

40
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.180
I won't do it right now.

41
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.370
The reason is, I haven't actually handled
the server program in this example,

42
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.230
simple example.

43
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.570
To discuss that in detail
is another presentation.

44
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.910
So, we're not gonna discuss
the server program in detail now.

45
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.470
On the form side of things, the HTML,
this is what it looks like.

46
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.560
This was my file selector.

47
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.405
This is the submit button, of course.

48
00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.640
And that's all we need, right?

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.760
Do those have the parameters
correct in the form at the top and

50
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.200
then you press Upload and
the file will go over to the server.

51
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.190
What does the server do?

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.431
Well, the server, program on the server,
as we briefly mentioned before,

53
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.570
it could do a million things.

54
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.980
For files,
it may have some extra things to do.

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.615
The server program has access
to the file sent by the browser.

56
00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:15.395
But it may have to, for example,
move the file to another directory.

57
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:19.014
It may have to change
the permissions of the file.

58
00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:23.427
It may have to do quite a lot of different
things, save the file in a database.

59
00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:27.299
It totally depends on the system
that you're building, okay?

60
00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.026
But in this presentation,

61
00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:32.941
we're just focused on the HTML
part of handling file upload.
