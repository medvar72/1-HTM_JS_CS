00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.690
Let's look at element grouping in HTML.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.630
So basically, this is just very simple
presentation talking about how to group

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.360
elements together into useful groups.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.240
Two elements we're gonna look at,
fieldset and legend.

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.210
So the idea is nothing too complicated,
but it's simply to put

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.760
items that work together in a similar
structure in the same structure.

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.650
There's two ways to think about this.

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.510
One is the visual output on the webpage,
and then the other is the code.

9
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.640
So, the code,
you might want to group things together.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
And the way to do that is to use
fieldset together with legend, and

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.390
when you look at your code,
you can realize, oh,

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.270
yes, I understand, these inputs
are related to personal information.

13
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.380
So it helps you as a programmer.

14
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.750
But also, there's a visual result,
which helps group this together as well.

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.860
So there's a visual side,
there's also a kind of programming side,

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.140
advantages to using fieldset and legend.

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.738
So, here, I've got my fieldset,
I've got my legend.

18
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.580
Personal information, two inputs.

19
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.340
What about here?

20
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.710
Another grouping, fieldset,
legend, Favorite things, okay?

21
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.640
So I've got two groups which
work together, all right?

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.300
What does it look like?

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.030
It looks like this.

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.410
So there's fieldset and
there's the legend.

25
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.310
This is fieldset has resulted
in the browser adding a box

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.620
around those things,
which are put together in the fieldset.

27
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.570
Okay, so I had a couple of things.

28
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.190
They're put together.

29
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.370
There's another couple of things.

30
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.610
They're put together.

31
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.550
It's a nice visual identity,
as well as, in the HTML,

32
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.550
a nice kind of coding identity as well,
grouping things together.

33
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.340
So that looks good.

34
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.310
This example is using a form.

35
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.180
But it doesn't have to be a form.

36
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.750
So, let's have a look at an example
which has nothing to do with forms.

37
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.720
This is just some kind of text
output in the web page, right?

38
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.170
A couple of things here.

39
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.890
A couple of things here.

40
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.320
I want it to be shown with a nice box
around it and a nice title at the top.

41
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.940
Nothing to do with forms.

42
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.810
Okay, I use the same code, and we get
a nice little summary, perhaps this is for

43
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.160
a game that you're building,
something like that.

44
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360
Enemies, friends, this doesn't
have to take up the whole page.

45
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.770
It could be over on the left hand side.

46
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.070
Or on the right hand side.

47
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.860
Maybe the bottom, the top,
you could put it in a div and

48
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.960
put the div at any location,
as we talked about it another video.

49
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.890
So it's a nice visual way
to group elements together.
