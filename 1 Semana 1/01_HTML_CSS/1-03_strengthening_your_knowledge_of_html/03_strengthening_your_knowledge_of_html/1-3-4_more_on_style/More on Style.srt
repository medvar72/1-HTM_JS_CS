00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay, let's have some more
discussion about style.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.275
So basically, after this presentation,
you'll understand inline style, and

3
00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.500
pseudo-classes, and

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.590
also a little bit about which rule
has more priority than other rules.

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.590
These are the pseudo-classes
we're gonna look at.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.400
So, first thing, inline style.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.790
So, inline style is
when you type the style

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.310
that you want to apply right there for
that particular element.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.480
So for
this particular paragraph we want to say

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.440
all the text will be on
the right hand side.

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.360
That's what we're saying right there.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.620
So that is inline style.

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.290
So that's very different to
what we've talked about before.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.020
Before, we talked about putting
style at the top of a page,

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110
and this is really the opposite.

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.110
This is saying, no, I don't wanna
put it on the top of the page.

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.960
I wanna put it right here for one
particular element right there, all right?

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.920
So it's harder to manage, because you
have to go through all the code, and

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.130
try to work out which
inline style is being used,

20
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.910
if everything is not at
the top in the style section.

21
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.310
So it can be a bit more troublesome.

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.440
Here's an example.

23
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.680
This has a list, unordered list.

24
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.150
And we have four list items in the list.

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.040
And we have a style rule at the top,

26
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.320
which says every list item is
gonna have a yellow background.

27
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.450
Okay.
No problem.

28
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.440
Four list items,
they will all have a yellow background.

29
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.090
However, down here, we said, no,

30
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.330
I want to apply this inline
style to the third list item.

31
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.330
So, because we've said this,
this is a higher priority than this.

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.960
So this one will indeed be in purple and
all the others will be in yellow.

33
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.750
So we get a result like this.

34
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.200
Yellow, yellow, yellow, but then we said
inline style for the third list item, so

35
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.770
it's purple.

36
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.730
It has a higher priority.

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.250
All right.

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.580
Let's talk about another thing.

39
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.790
Context control for style rules.

40
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.590
You could have a rule
which looks like this.

41
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.850
And it says all right, list items,
those will be red color.

42
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.970
But what it actually says is list items
which are within an unordered list,

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.730
those list items, no other list items,
will be red, all right?

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.670
So, list item inside unordered list, red.

45
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.500
Any other list item will not be red.

46
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.910
So here's an example piece of code.

47
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.610
We've got a list and another list.

48
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.450
This one is an unordered list,
this one is an ordered list.

49
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.290
And then we've said up here, a rule.

50
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.410
So we've said list items
in the unordered list,

51
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.880
that's the first list,
they will be yellow.

52
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.790
Now, that will not apply
to the second list.

53
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.840
So here's the result.

54
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.060
You can see the style rule has not
been applied to the second list, but

55
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.700
it got applied to the first list.

56
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.137
Let's look at another subject,
pseudo-classes.

57
00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:16.340
So, pseudo-classes are basically
classes with, what I tend to say is,

58
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.130
some kind of intelligence,
some kind of extra capability.

59
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.450
So here's the first one, and it is hover.

60
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.290
So it's saying when the user
puts their mouse over heading 1,

61
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.870
it will change to red.

62
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.930
So, put your mouse over heading 1,
the color of the text will become red.

63
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.070
Move your mouse away from the heading 1,
it will go back to the previous color.

64
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.940
So that's hover, so it's some kind
of intelligence, if you like.

65
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.850
Now, there's a lot of these
pseudo-classes, many, many, of them.

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.370
So let's just have
a look at a few of them.

67
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.770
So for example, here, if you have a link,
then that will be a red color, all right?

68
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.200
Now that applies to a, because actually,
that's what a link is.

69
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.270
So it has to be a.

70
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.200
Remember a, anchor.

71
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.770
So, any link will be red color.

72
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.070
What about here?

73
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.850
visited.

74
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.060
That means that the person who is using
the browser, if they have visited

75
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.270
a link and the link is shown on
the webpage, then you can fix up a color.

76
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.560
So again, that has to be for
a, because a is for links.

77
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.980
So anything that you have visited
will be shown in red color.

78
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.580
active.

79
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.040
So, active means you
are currently following the link.

80
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.830
You're currently following the link.

81
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.540
Now that could be just
like 0.1 of a second.

82
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540
You've clicked on a link, and

83
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.020
the browser is just going and
grabbing the next webpage and

84
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.540
building it, and then it displays
the link, it could be very, very quick.

85
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.060
Even though it's very quick, there is
a pseudo-class for handling that, you're

86
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.485
currently following and grabbing the next
webpage, because you clicked on a link.

87
00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:13.750
All right, it will apply this style.

88
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.050
And again, that has to be for
a, cuz it's all about links.

89
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.690
What about this one?

90
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.735
Well, this one doesn't have to be for a.

91
00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:22.650
This is pretty straightforward.

92
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.270
This is any element which is empty.

93
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.730
It has nothing inside it.

94
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.450
All right, it could be every
paragraph which is empty.

95
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.180
It will use this style rule.

96
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.240
So this is just five of them, but
there's actually another, 20, 30, 40,

97
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.270
a lot more pseudo-classes.

98
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.640
So here's an example.

99
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.900
And we've set up these rules that we
just looked at, the pseudo-classes,

100
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.930
and we built a simple
webpage to explore them.

101
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.505
And then it looks like this, and so
we can try some of these out, but

102
00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:59.085
some of them, remember,
are quite hard to see.

103
00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:01.445
So let's go for the hardest one first.

104
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:04.335
Remember, the hardest
one is the active link.

105
00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:08.380
Okay, that is the link that
is currently being processed.

106
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.710
It may be hard to see.

107
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.220
Purple.

108
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.430
So, active link, it will become purple.

109
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.140
So let's try to open the example, and
then we'll play with it and try these out.

110
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.070
Active link will become purple
is the first one we'll try.

111
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:30.430
So here's the example,
let's try that first one.

112
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.660
Active link should become purple, but you
may have to be very quick with your eyes,

113
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.640
but let's try it.

114
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.120
There's four links here and a list,

115
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.940
a series of lists here,
one single list with lots of list items.

116
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.320
So let's try the active link.

117
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.150
So I'm gonna click on this one, and yes,

118
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.330
it managed to show that in
the correct style very quickly.

119
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.290
Okay, so that was active link.

120
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.750
What else did we have?

121
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.210
We had a link which has not yet
been activated.

122
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.920
You can see there's some yellow
color being applied behind it.

123
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.250
And what about if we
have visited the link?

124
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.950
Well, now we have visited the link, so
it's using that style rule as well.

125
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.262
Down here we have empty
style rule being used.

126
00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:26.270
All right, so this particular
list item had nothing inside it,

127
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.130
so that triggered the use
of that particular style.

128
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.510
And then the other thing we used
was hover, so let's show hover.

129
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.520
So you can see if I put my mouse over
these, they change the background color.

130
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.800
Okay, a little bit hard to demonstrate
some pseudo-classes because they

131
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.180
have some kind of intelligence,
if you like.

132
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.240
But yes, you can see mouseover has
triggered the different style.

133
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.479
So that's our brief introduction to
three different areas of styles,

134
00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:04.457
including this one,
which is pseudo-classes.
