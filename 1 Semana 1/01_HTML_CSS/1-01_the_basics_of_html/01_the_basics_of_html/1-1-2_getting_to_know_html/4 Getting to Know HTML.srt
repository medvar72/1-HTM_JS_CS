WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.660
So now let's begin to explore HTML.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.140
So after this presentation you'll be
able to build a simple web page and

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.300
also you'll appreciate
the use of an HTML editor.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.100
Here's some of the HTML
elements we're gonna look at.

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.140
So, first thing is, HTML is defined by

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.290
a particular group of people called
the World Wide Web Consortium.

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.950
So there is a particular place on
the internet where you can go.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.990
And you can see all
the information about HTML.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.880
And I strongly recommend you
don't go there, all right,

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.518
unless you're kind of an expert.

11
00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:44.080
You're really already
quite proficient in HTML.

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.850
All of that detail there, because there's
a lot of detail, is really too much.

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.960
It's not about learning,
it's about referring to the HTML standard.

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.500
So this might be useful later after
you build your HTML skills, but

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.280
right now I would suggest, don't go there.

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.980
So lets look at HTML.

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.940
HTML commands are called elements.

18
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.330
Each element has a start tag and
an end tag.

19
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.790
So this is the paragraph element.

20
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.480
There's the start of the paragraph.

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.200
There's the end of the paragraph.

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000
And there's some text which I
haven't shown in the middle of

23
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.710
the paragraph, okay?

24
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.730
That's the usual structure, start,
end, something in the middle.

25
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.436
However, there are some exceptions
which we'll look at later.

26
00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:33.590
So, let's begin to make a webpage.

27
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.890
This is the basic structure of a webpage.

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.810
You have to have DOCTYPE html at the top,
then you start your html element.

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.730
And down the bottom you
finish your html element.

30
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.300
And then you have a head section,
and then you have a body section.

31
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.490
Okay, so this head section is basically

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.140
some kinds of information which
you don't see on the web page.

33
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.690
The body section is more things that
you actually see on the web page.

34
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340
So, our first web page.

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.060
There's the complete source code.

36
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.640
We've done the things that we
saw on the last slide, and

37
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.460
we've added a few extra things.

38
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.840
A couple of extra things
in the head section.

39
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.160
A couple of extra things in
the body section as well.

40
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.990
This is what it looks like.

41
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.950
My web page.

42
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.627
Web page is awesome.

43
00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:21.438
Very simple.

44
00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:23.251
That is the <h1>.

45
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.080
That is the P that we saw, paragraph.

46
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.550
So we saw <h1>, the top thing and
we saw P, the paragraph.

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.180
So <h1> is heading 1.

48
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.870
Again, start tag, end tags,
some text in the middle.

49
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.750
Basic structure of most HTML elements.

50
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.400
And also paragraph,
start paragraph, end paragraph, and

51
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.240
then some text in the middle.

52
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.150
Basic commands that you'll
see on many web pages.

53
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.230
Now, let's look, for a few slides,
let's look at the head part.

54
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.250
The stuff that we just talked about,
<h1>, and paragraph, was in the body part.

55
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.940
What about the head part?

56
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.515
So, basically, anything in the head
part is information about the webpage.

57
00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:09.425
Usually you don't actually see
those things in the webpage.

58
00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:15.445
So I had two things in my simple
demonstration webpage and

59
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.245
one was title and meta tag.

60
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.680
Obvious what they do.Title tells the
browser what the title is of the webpage.

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
And the meta tag, obviously,
tells the browser the author.

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.580
So, pretty simple, high level information
about the web page goes in the head part.

63
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.270
Other things you might
find in the head part.

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.890
You might see style instruction.

65
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.210
We'll talk about style a bit later.

66
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.320
You might see a link to a style sheet,

67
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.450
which is a separate file
containing style information.

68
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.610
You might see other types
of meta information.

69
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.720
Maybe description, key words,
maybe character set.

70
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.910
Lots of different type of meta information
you might see in a web page head section.

71
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.190
Other things you might see,
a piece of JavaScript code.

72
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.800
That might be in the head.

73
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.590
A link to a file which
has JavaScript code.

74
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.630
JavaScript, we talk about that later.

75
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.340
Okay.

76
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.720
You might see a base instruction and

77
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.160
that's basically saying you have
a website, a whole group of web pages.

78
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.030
Where are they going?

79
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.190
Where do they belong?

80
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.020
And it tells the browser
where they belong.

81
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.900
So, quite a lot of things that you
might see in the head section.

82
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.750
So, we've got lots of elements in HTML.

83
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.990
And some of them have attributes,
parameters, if you like.

84
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.825
So there's one attribute,
another attribute for the meta element.

85
00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:44.305
So you can use speech marks,
double speech marks if you like.

86
00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:46.215
And there's double speech marks.

87
00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:49.985
But also, if you want,
you can use single speech marks.

88
00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:50.965
Both of them are fine.

89
00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.205
The browser doesn't
care which one you use.

90
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:58.010
So, let's begin to learn HTML a bit more.

91
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.680
Different ways of learning.

92
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.700
One way is to look at the source
code of any web page.

93
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.078
So here's an example, Wikipedia web page.

94
00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:09.760
A website which has lots
of general information,

95
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
encyclopedia information about
millions of things around the world.

96
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.430
Go to that in your web browser and hit the
keyboard shortcut such as CTRL+U on a PC.

97
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.840
Or some other shortcuts on a Mac.

98
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.870
And you will see the source code.

99
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.348
And perhaps we'll have a quick
look at that right now.

100
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.855
So for example,
this is the website for Wikipedia.

101
00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:40.205
I'd like to learn the HTML
from this website.

102
00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:44.975
So I'm going to go over to my computer and
do CTRL+U because this is a PC and

103
00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.055
just have a quick look at the HTML code.

104
00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:50.465
All right.

105
00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:54.440
This is the source code for
the Wikipedia website.

106
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.290
I can see things I already know about.

107
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.420
DOCTYPE html, start html, the head
section begins, meta tags, titles.

108
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.410
All of these things,
a lot of them I know already.

109
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.080
Even though, I just began to look at html.

110
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.780
But some things I don't know.

111
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.330
We can't cover everything
in this series of videos.

112
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.290
For example,
html it can have a language attribute.

113
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.880
This particular webpage
is in English language.

114
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.140
Okay, we don't have time to look
at all of these attributes.

115
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.210
You can learn them by
looking at websites and

116
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.140
looking at the source code
of different websites.

117
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.150
So here's a header section, if I keep
going down I'll see the body section.

118
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.450
I can learn a lot of things by
looking at this kinda website.

119
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.040
Okay, another way to learn HTML is
to look at different HTML editors.

120
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.550
All right, there's hundreds of editors.

121
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.330
Many, many to a quick google search and
you'll find a big, long list.

122
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.480
So they give you a nice, GUI environment,
a nice graphical user interface.

123
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.650
So that you can build HTML and you can
also see the source code that they create.

124
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.490
So these editors,

125
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.450
they're useful sometimes, especially
useful for complementing learning.

126
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.980
That's not replacing learning, but
complementing your learning of HTML.

127
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.990
Let's look at an example.

128
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.910
So here's an HTML editor,
this one is called TinyMCE.

129
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.780
And it actually works inside a webpage,
because this is actually a webpage.

130
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.140
And so let's do a quick example.

131
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.830
I'm gonna type some text here
in my little GUI environment.

132
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.980
And then I'm gonna apply some formatting.

133
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.450
I'm gonna apply the <h1> format.

134
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.600
All right.

135
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.430
So, I'm gonna type some text,
it's going to be very small.

136
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.160
You won't see it very clearly.

137
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.080
And I'm gonna add the <h1> style.

138
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.930
And then you'll see it and it a little bit
bigger and we can see the source code.

139
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.080
So, let's do some typing.

140
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:58.580
This is my webpage, something like that,
extremely small you can't really see it.

141
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.130
Let's select it and then apply a format.

142
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.620
And we're talking about the <h1> format.

143
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.190
And yes,
now we can see that we have a large

144
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.400
size of text that is
using the head <h1> tag.

145
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.650
Now what about my source code?

146
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.940
I wanna look at the code
created by the editor.

147
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.920
So I can copy it,
paste it into my own system.

148
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.310
So let's have a look at the source code.

149
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.000
And I can access that with
this particular menu.

150
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.750
So let's click and
look at the source code.

151
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.080
And make it a bit larger so
you can see it.

152
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.730
And there is my source code.

153
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.465
Fantastic, I didn't
have to type it myself.

154
00:08:38.465 --> 00:08:40.670
<h1>This is my web page.</h1>.

155
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.050
And I could copy that,

156
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.550
put it in my own web page,
put it in my own web system if I like.

157
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.490
Of course it's not just the simple things.

158
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.500
Like, <h1>.

159
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.530
There's a hundred different things
you could do with editors and

160
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.220
they'll construct the source code and
then you copy it and paste it.

161
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.800
Does it replace learning?

162
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.930
No, it doesn't really replace learning.

163
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.900
You still have to understand
everything it generates, okay?

164
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.310
So that's the end of our
first discussion about HTML.
